A simple Penrose tiling visualization in Processing

![small penrose](penrose/small_penrose.png)

A [Penrose tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling) is interesting because it is aperiodic (never repeats) but can go on forever. This is a visualization in Processing of the P2 version of a Penrose tiling and was adapted from [this project](http://preshing.com/20110831/penrose-tiling-explained/).  It works by dividing triangular tiles into sets of smaller tiles.
